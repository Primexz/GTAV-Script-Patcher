# GTAV Script Patcher
This is a very simple application to patch the script version of GTA Scripts.
I use this application to patch my scripts for [this repo](https://github.com/Primexz/GTAV-Decompiled-Scripts).

## Prerequisites
This application is written in Javascript and accordingly requires Node-JS

## Usage

1. copy your scripts into the ``scripts`` folder
2. ``node ./index.js``
3. after the program has run, you will find the edited scripts again from the **scri√ºts** folder.
